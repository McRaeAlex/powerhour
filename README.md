# Powerhour

Using the Spotify API the application will change the song on the minute mark to allow the drinking game powerhour to work.

I threw this together in about 3 hours while riding the [Ballmer Peak](https://xkcd.com/323/)

## The game

Every minute the song changes, every new song you take a shot for an hour.

## To do

- Style it
- Allow the user to add more time for songs if they aren't get to the drop of a song or something
- Allow setting the number of songs to play in a playlist rather than the entire playlist.
- Allow more than a minute to be used.
- Clean up the code (refactor)
